# Outline

This design component requires that you and your team measure the adequacy of your test suite using one or more code coverage tools and report about the pros and cons of your metrics and tool choices

Measurement of code coverage is performed in two main steps. First, classes must be selected for instrumentation. Classes selected for instrumentation are the classes which will have the coverage measured. Then, the test suite must be run with a coverage tool. You can use any coverage analysis tool. You need to report three coverage metrics (the suggested metrics to report are: statement, branch, and condition coverages).

NOTE1: If the coverage tool that you are using does not support any of the above metrics, first try another tool. If none reports the above measures, then replace the missing measure with another metric that the tool supports, e.g. you might decide to replace condition coverage with method coverage, if you are using EclEmma

NOTE2: Document all coverage tools you tried and what worked or did not work for your configuration. Explain what you fixed (e.g., removing mock objects, updating IDEs, switching to another tool, etc.)

NOTE3: You need to report the pros and cons of tools you tried and the metrics you chose.

To become more familiar with data flow coverage and achieve a deeper understanding of how coverage tools work, calculate the DU-pair coverage for two methods, by hand. The methods to analyze are: DataUtilities.calculateColumnTotal and one method of your choice from the org.jfree.data.Range class (that you have a test set for, from Assignment 2). Calculate the DU-pair coverage by tracing through the execution of each of your test cases for these methods, manually. This will need to be included in your report. You need to report the followings per method:

the data flow graph

the def-use sets per statement

list all DU-pairs per variable

for each test case show which pairs are covered

calculate the DU-Pair coverage

In this section, you will be required to design new unit tests for two classes to increase their code coverage. The classes to be tested are: org.jfree.data.DataUtilities and org.jfree.data.Range. Note that although the focus in adequacy criteria has changed (it is now on source code), to develop new test cases the test oracle should still be derived from the requirements (as contained in the Javadocs of the SUT)

As with any testing to be done, to begin with, a plan must be created. Document this test plan, as it will be included with your lab report. This plan should include information about who will create which tests, how you plan to develop tests to achieve the adequacy criteria. For thiassignment, a test suite should be developed which has at least thfollowing coverage for each of the classes under test

Minimum coverage:

90% statement coverage

70% branch coverage

60% condition coverage

Students should now have a good understanding of measuring test suite adequacy based on coverage of the SUT’s code. This should include an understanding of some of the different control flow and data flow coverage criteria, and the relative difficulty to satisfy these coverage criteria. Students should now have an idea of some of the trade-offs that occur when choosing different test suite adequacy criteria for testing

# 1 Introduction

Software testing is a process that takes a serious amount of time to plan and schedule, as in order to enusre that your test cases and suites are actually effective developers and engineers must carefully examine their existing code. In contrary to black-box testing, white-box testing allows a developer access to the code and documentation. This means that intead of looking at a program from an outisde perspective, we actually know the logic and paths that a program has, which also means that we are able to expand on the kind of test cases we can create. Now, us testers must consider the coverage of the tests, whether they are able to account for every possible statement, condition, branch and decision that a program will make. 


# 2 Manual data-flow coverage calculations for X and Y methods

Check coverage for current (how the fuck do you make a manual calculation, maybe make a CFG)

Range:
    Due to the limted logic and constructor throwing exceptions when lower is larger than upper in the Range class the possiblility of full data-flow coverage is very limited. This results in in branches not being taken, as without setters for upper and lower or a change to the constructor the branches within our 5 fucntions will always be missed. There is also somthing to note as the definitions for all these functions will always be 0, as these values are made and assigned in the constructor wich is not a part of the functions we are testing. In order to make clear the method used for manual calculations, assume we make nodes for each line of code in each function starting at 1, while the contructor initalization is 0.

|-------|-------------------|----------|------------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|
| lower | ToString()        |  None    | use(1)                 | du(0, lower) = [0, 1]                 |    None      | True         |
|       | GetUpperBound()   |  None    | use(1), use(2), use(3) | du(0, lower) = {[0, 1, 3], [0, 1, 2]} |    None      | True, False  |
|       | GetLowerBound()   |  None    | use(1), use(2), use(3) | du(0, lower) = {[0, 1, 3], [0, 1, 2]} |    None      | True, Flase  |
|       | GetCentralValue() |  None    | use(1)                 | du(0, lower) = [0, 1]                 |    None      | True         |
|       | GetLength()       |  None    | use(1), use(2), use(3) | du(0, lower) = {[0, 1, 3], [0, 1, 2]} |    None      | True, False  |
| upper |

with the inclusion of the branches:
    True / Total = 5 / 8 * 100 = 62.5%

without the inclusion of the branches:
    True / Total = 5/5 * 100 = 100%


# 3 A detailed description of the testing strategy for the new unit test

1. Statement Coverage
     Rationale (why do we need it): Faults cannot be discovered
    if code lines containing them are not executed
     Statement coverage criterion: Equivalent to covering all
    nodes in CFG
     Executing a statement is a weak guarantee of correctness,
    but rather easy to achieve
     In general, several inputs execute the same statements

2. Decision (Branch) Coverage
     Branch coverage relates to decisions in
    a program
     e.g. an IF statement has always two
    branches
     Example: Branch coverage for the
    example given TC: (a = 1, b = 2)
     Given control flow graph (CFG)
    of a program
     Select a test set such that, by
    executing the program for each
    test case in the set, each edge of
    CFG’s decision (predicate)
    node(s) is traversed at least once
     We need to exercise all decision
    that traverse the control flow of
    the program with True and False
    values

    3. Condition Coverage
     Condition coverage is a more powerful test coverage criteria
     Condition Coverage (CC) Criterion: Design a test set such that each
    individual condition in the program to be both True and False
    (regardless of the truth or falsity of predicates combining those
    conditions)  this may cause branch coverage suffer though (see next
    slide’s example)
     We should usually consider both branch (decision) and condition
    coverage together
     How? by executing the program for each element in the set, all
    possible values of the constituents of compound conditions (defined
    below) are exercised at least once
     Compound conditions: C1 and C2 or C3 ... where Ci’s are relational
    expressions or Boolean variables (atomic conditions)

# 6 Pros and Cons of coverage tools used and Metrics you report

The only coverage tools used was (INPUT HERE), the metrics that we used from the tool only gave a calculation on the coverage as a whole. This meant that we had to manually calculate the coverage for things like branches and path coverage. METRICS HERE

# 8 A discussion on how the team work/effort was divided and managed

The lab begain with the splitting up of classes to review and change. Becasue we are re-using code from the previous assignment, we decided to split members accoding to the tests they had worked on in assignment 2. This made the review and edit of the code far easier as each member was familiar with the suites they worked on. Due to the difference in coverage and logic complexity, the people who worked on the Range class took more responsibility with the lab report, documentation and scheduling in order to lessen the load on members that had to make more drastic change to thier code. 

# 9 Any difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned from performing the lab

A difficulty faced in this lab was the planning phase of the assignment. Becasue we are white-box testing we now have to consider a far more complex planning phase along with the review and consideration of the code we have previously made in assignment 2. Despite the issues faced, the biggest lesson we did learn was also how to plan and execute white-box and coverage testing. This lab allowed for a lot of experimentaton and exploration of how these can be done, even if you have code that is mostly covered, you can still find ways to make it better. 

# 10 Comments/feedback on the lab itself

Some of the instructions can be slightly confusing, it might be an improvement to provide a little more detail as to what is required with the manual calculations and planning documentation. White-box testing can be complex and confusing when in practice for the first time, so some more guidance on would provide more chances to learn this process. On the other hand, this lab was a educational look at how we can always imporve the coverage and functionality of testing, especially when you have already testing a program using different methods.
